AWS cloud services are improving with time, and I am enjoying using their services. We all know that using 3rd part services in our application adds additional constraints to our services. Compared to benefits, those restrictions may sometimes be manageable. 

## The Problem:
I have come across a problem where API request timeout is restricted due to vendor (AWS in my case) and canâ€™t increase after max timeout value (30 sec). Daily multiple batches ran by different API consumers that experienced timeout for some requests amounting to 3â€“4% of the total request sent.

I have discussed above issue in depth in below article ðŸ˜‰.
