I had created a demo application in my free time which uses pub/sub for sharing messages between 2 java microservice application using Kafka as middleware. Later on, `I starter experimenting on effect of different garbage collection algorithm using some popular tools.`

After trying out different algorithm, `I am surprised that same code could get faster if right garbage collection algorithm is configured` for the application.

I have created an article to document same thing.
