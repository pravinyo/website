## What is NGINX?

NGINX is a powerful, versatile tool that serves multiple critical functions in modern web infrastructure:

### Web Server
- Serves web content efficiently
- Handles static files with high performance
- Supports modern protocols and standards

### Reverse Proxy
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers
- **Backend Routing**: Intelligently routes requests based on various criteria
- **Caching**: Stores frequently requested content for faster delivery
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for microservices architecture
