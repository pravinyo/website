> ...Ahem...Why I still see non-sense naming?
{: .prompt-warning }

I recall encountering a few naming smells in the legacy system, during migration activity. There I saw `three files with similar name in the production infrastructure code`. 

## Context 
As per new business requirement, I had to make some enhancements to the existing service to **use different authorization tokens based on environments**. Config/Code level changes were pretty straight forward.

I encountered an actual problem when I wanted to deploy my changes to a non-dev environment (like release assurance and Prod). There, I needed to add some additional changes to `Jenkins credentials`, deployment `pipeline code`, and `helm chart`. 

## The Problem
```
Prod.yaml
Prod-new.yaml
Prod-new-new.yaml
```

I saw the above three files for both `release assurance` and `production` environment. In that legacy system, no active development was happening. When I checked git logs for the latest changes, **I failed to figure out which file I needed to change**. Only one of those configurations is in use in the deployment pipeline.

## Which one is it?

After checking the commit, I saw `all three was updated same time`. It is weird. **_Why does someone updated all three files when only one is in used?_**

**You may say, It could be to have a backup of the configuration**. As git is been used for a long time, I donâ€™t see any reason for the backup. If you want to revert to 1 month older configurations, you can easily do it. 

Ok, **I already spent more than 20 mins**, and I was thinking `prod.yaml` should be the one, but to double confirm, _I checked with the infra folks for what file I have to update_, and there I came to know I have to update `prod-new-new.yaml`.

## What? Why this weird naming format?

I asked the same question, but they were saying, **Pravin that been there for a long time, and what can we do?** I donâ€™t understand How come that change at that time got approved.
