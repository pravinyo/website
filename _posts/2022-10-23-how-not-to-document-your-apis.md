## How (Not) To document Your APIs

In this presentation, I talked about the troubles I faced due to poor API design. It happened due to less emphasis on documenting changes. Developers who do not have access to the internal code of the API will only have to rely on provided document.

I shared four instances where poor documentation caused more pain than helping me to make a sound judgment about the effort required to integrate that API into my change.
